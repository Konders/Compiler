With this resource you can easily compile your resources.

Your resource data dont need a backup, because its create a file with the same name but it has an .luac extension.

Compilation would start when you start/restart your resource.
So you can edit for example client.lua in your resource and restart it, after that resource would run already compiled client.luac
